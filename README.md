# Dockerfile Entrypoint Issue
This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: an incorrect or missing entrypoint. The provided Dockerfile attempts to run a Python script but fails because it doesn't specify a proper entrypoint that sets up the execution environment.  The solution demonstrates how to correctly define an entrypoint.

## Bug
The original `Dockerfile` attempts to run a Python script using the `CMD` instruction without setting up the execution environment. This causes a failure during image execution because the program isn't within the working directory or the path environment variable.

## Solution
The `Dockerfile_solution` provides a corrected version by adding an `ENTRYPOINT` instruction, ensuring the application runs correctly within the defined environment.
